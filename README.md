# Shit Going Down

## Description
This is an interactive live map of the world that aggregates news and tweets - but the interesting part is that I've created an algorithm that performs sentiment analysis on the incoming news articles to determine how "happy" or "sad" or "political" etc. an article is. So the program displays a heat map over laid on the world map based on these labelled sentiments. Further yet, as the program runs, the user can "upvote" or "downvote" a displayed article, and then using a machine learning algorithm, the program will display more or less of that type of article pandora-style (the typings being based on the sentiments).
