One of the longest baby-waiting vigils this time was held by Terry Hutt, an 82-year-old carpenter wearing a suit made with a Union Jack pattern. He had been sleeping outside the hospital on a bench for 15 days, having received contradictory reports about the Duchess of Cambridge’s due date. As a gift for the baby, he had brought a piggy bank, also printed with the Union Jack.
When the new prince’s birth was announced, Mr. Hutt held up a baby doll that had been fitted with a crown, with blue eyes that opened and closed. He and the small knot of hard-core royalists drank sparkling wine in plastic pint glasses."Hip hip hurray!"" they shouted. "Hip hip hurray! It’s a prince, born on St. George’s Day!""Gary Petersen, 60, who was visiting from Australia, said his daughter had texted him Monday morning from Perth with news of the baby’s birth. Standing opposite the front door of the maternity ward, he confessed he expected something grander.“This is the infamous Lindo Wing,” he said. “Have a look around, it’s an industrial estate, not very glamorous.”As an Australian, he said, he viewed the monarchy from a skeptical distance, but he said he thought Princes Harry and William had helped to “re-establish the credibility” of the royal family by opening up about their mother’s death.“If I have one negative about the queen, it’s that, apart from the opening of the Olympic Games, she’s too rigid, in my opinion,” he said. “I suppose from an Australian point of view, it’s figurehead, it doesn’t have a role in the day-to-day running of the country.” hello
